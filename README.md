## VendR - Customizable Vending Machine

VendR is a customizable vending machine entity that removes the complex tasks for end users of modifying config files
and instead aims to allow users to set up the addon within the game itself.
This eliminates the need to reboot the server after each change to the addon, and allows for users to quickly set up
the entity with several easy to change options.
