the CLua entry is used to add scripting to your items in the form of callback functions when a player attempts to purchase an item.

If you are experienced with lua, this will be very easy to graps.

VSHARE is a temporary table created when a player attempts to buy an item. The values assigned to VSHARE are as follows:
ply : this is the player that has triggered the buy function
self : this is the vending machine entity
time : this is the time at which the function was executed
ent : this is the item that will be spawned (will be a nil value if spawning the item is not possible)
item : this is the item table used to spawn the item, includes price, name, etc.
nosound : you have the option to set this in your callback function, setting it to true will disable the vending machine from playing a sound

access VSHARE as if it were a global table, using VSHARE.<var>

VSHARE is cleared after the function is called.

returning false from your callback will disable the default behavior (such as spawning an entity)
and allows you to write your own conditions.

An example of what this can be used for is for example, giving players the ability to purchase perks, interact with other
addons, buy ranks with in-game money, disallow players from buying items if they are not a certain rank, etc.
